# I develop a n8n workflow that get triggred by email and if it contains invoice then parse the invoice
# Model downlaod the invoice and uplaod it onto google drive
# For extracting data I used Google Gemini 
# For storing data I used Airtable
# Airtable contains a column which will store the link of googl drive where the invoice get uploaded.

Basically model automate the manual invoice parsing and stored the required information in Airtable.
